README.md - Bit Manipulation Project
Project Overview
In this project, you will learn how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C. The goal is to gain an understanding of how bitwise operations work, why they are used, and how to implement them efficiently. You'll learn to solve problems related to manipulating data at the binary level and use bitwise operators in practical applications.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to:

Look for the right source of information when you encounter issues or need clarification on how bitwise operations work.
Manipulate bits and use bitwise operators effectively, including AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shift operators (<<, >>).
Requirements
General Guidelines
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation Environment:
Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options:
bash
Copier le code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
Make sure your code works without errors when compiled with these options.
File Formatting:
All your files must end with a new line.
Use Betty style for code formatting. Your code will be checked using the betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl scripts.
No global variables are allowed.
No more than 5 functions per file.
You are only allowed to use the following C standard library functions: malloc, free, and exit. Functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., are not allowed.
You are allowed to use the function _putchar, but you should not push the _putchar.c file. We will use our own version for compilatio
