# Doubly Linked List Project

This project implements a doubly linked list in C, with basic operations such as adding nodes at the beginning or end, printing the list, finding its length, and freeing all nodes.

## Requirements
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.5
- Code must follow Betty style.
- Functions should be declared in the `lists.h` header file.

## File Structure
- `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and the doubly linked list node structure.
- `.c` files: Implementation files containing the logic for the list operations.

## Functions
- `add_node_end`: Adds a node to the end of the list.
- `print_dlistint`: Prints the list.
- `dlistint_len`: Returns the length of the list.
- `free_dlistint`: Frees the entire list.
- `add_node_begin`: Adds a node at the beginning of the list.
